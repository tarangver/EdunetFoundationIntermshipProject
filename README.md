# House Price Prediction 🏠📊

This machine learning project was developed during my internship under the **Edunet Foundation** in collaboration with the **IBM SkillsBuild Program**. The aim was to build a robust regression-based system to predict house prices based on multiple real-world features such as area, location, number of rooms, and other attributes.

## 💼 About the Internship

The internship provided by **Edunet Foundation** under the **IBM SkillsBuild** initiative was focused on hands-on learning in data science, machine learning, and project-based application of Python. As an intern, I gained exposure to real datasets and implemented end-to-end ML pipelines using industry-standard tools.

## 📊 Project Overview

The goal was to build a regression model that accurately predicts house prices based on multiple features such as:

- Area  
- Location  
- Number of bedrooms, bathrooms  
- Furnishing status  
- BHK and square footage  

The dataset used:  
📁 [`HousePricePrediction.csv`](https://github.com/tarangver/EdunetFoundationIntermshipProject/blob/main/HousePricePrediction.csv)

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models Used

Several models were trained and evaluated:

- ✅ **Linear Regression**  
- ✅ **Decision Tree Regressor**  
- ✅ **Random Forest Regressor**  
- ✅ **Gradient Boosting Regressor**

---

## 🧪 Model Evaluation

Each model was compared using:

- R² Score  
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

Best performance was observed using **Gradient Boosting**, due to its ability to handle non-linear patterns and reduce overfitting.
